Hi Thu,

Thanks for completing Take-home project 5. You have done a nice job.

Again, you may want to use the codes in Jupyter notebook for the reasons we discussed in the course.

You score for the Take-home project 5 is 14/15. Due to your late submission your final score is 12/15

Should you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Quynh
