Hi Thu,

Thanks for completing Take-home project 6. You have done a good job.

At the same time, you may want to use the codes in Jupyter notebook for the reasons we discussed in the course.

Week 6 is about basic inferential statistics in Python only. There are a lot more Python can do for inferential statistics.

You score for the Take-home project 6 is 18/20. Due to your late submission your final score is 16/20

Should you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Quynh
